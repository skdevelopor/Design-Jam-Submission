                                Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and
                                businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal),
                                SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003.</li>
                            <li>Musk became a
                                multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company,
                                Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. </li>
                            <li> Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a
                                rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International
                                Space Station.</li>
                            <li class="last"> He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity
                                in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on
                                an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's
                                administration.</li>

                <li>Early Life
                    <ul class="whoelonmusk">
                        <div class="welmusk">
                            <li>Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost
                                in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check
                                his hearing.
                            </li>
                            <li>At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in
                                computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first
                                software: a game he created called Blastar.</li>
                            <li class="last">In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish. He was bullied
                                until he was 15
                                and went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and
                                wrestling.</li>

                <li>Family
                    <ul class="whoelonmusk">
                        <div class="welmusk">
                            <li>Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a
                                Covergirl campaign. When Musk was growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to
                                support her family.
                            </li>
                            <li> Musk’s father, Errol Musk, is a wealthy South African engineer.</li>
                            <li class="last"> Musk spent his early childhood with his brother Kimbal and sister Tosca in
                                South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10.</li>

                                At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid
                                mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship
                                that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via
                                that path.
                            </li>
                            <li>In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of
                                Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a
                                second bachelor’s degree in physics.
                            </li>
                            <li class="last">After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to
                                pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet
                                boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it,
                                launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in
                                2002.
